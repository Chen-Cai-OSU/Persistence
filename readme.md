# Environment setup
Install [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/). Take a look
at this [viedo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz6r0id2apA) if you run into some trouble.

To run the tutorial, you will need to install
* pip install matplotlib numpy
* Install [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html), [sklearn-tda](https://github.com/MathieuCarriere/sklearn-tda)
* (optional) it is recommended that you also install jupyter notebook. Take a look at 
this quick start [guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

IDE
You may consider install [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as your IDE. Either professional or free community version is fine.

* download the repository: ``git clone git@github.com:Chen-Cai-OSU/Persistence.git``

* go to the downloaded folder: ``cd Persistence``

* run the example: ``python tutorial.py``


# Tutorial for Clustering Persistence Diagrams
You can run either tutorial.py or tutorial.ipynb. The code are exactly the same.

First go through tutorial.ipynb and make sure you understand the related concepts. 
Once you are confident about the all the functions (I added some comments for most functions), feel free to modify it such as changeing kernels 
or clustering algorithm.
