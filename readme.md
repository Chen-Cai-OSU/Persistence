# Tutorial for Clustering Persistence Diagrams

You will need to install
* Install [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html), [sklearn-tda](https://github.com/MathieuCarriere/sklearn-tda)
* pip install matplotlib numpy


First go through tutorial.ipynb and make sure you understand the related concepts. 
Once you are confident about the all the functions (I added some comments for most functions), feel free to modify it such as changeing kernels 
or clustering algorithm.
